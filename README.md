**tRiS** is a shiny app for the visualization and analysis of spatio-temporal medical or biological data. This application enables visualization by means of maps and prediction of successive measurements of any (properly formatted) numerical data with spatial and temporal attributes. The user can perform all the functions of the application on the example datasets contained in the app.

The purpose of the application is to facilitate the understanding of certain dependencies in the data and to find the necessary information. Generalization of the operation on any data allows the application to be used in various projects or analyzes, making it more useful for a larger group of recipients.
